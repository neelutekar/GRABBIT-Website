#### Description:
My name is **Neel Utekar**. I am a 19-year-old first-year B.Tech Engineering student from Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. I have a strong interest in computer science and web development. I enjoy learning how things work behind the scenes on the internet. As part of my self-learning journey, I created **Grabbit**, a web-based application inspired by OLX. This project allowed me to apply what I've learned and explore full-stack development.

**Grabbit** is a platform modeled after OLX. It lets users buy and sell used items by creating online classified ads. The main idea is to provide a simple system where individuals can register, log in, manage their profiles, and post listings. Each listing includes important details like the product name, description, price, image, and location. It creates a user-driven marketplace where people can find or list second-hand items easily.

This project uses the **Flask** web framework in Python for development. The backend relies on **SQLAlchemy**, with **SQLite** as the database. All user data, listings, and session details are stored securely in a local database file named `site.db`, located in the `instance/` folder. Users must register and log in to access essential functions like creating, editing, or deleting product listings. For user authentication, **Flask-Login** is used, and all passwords are saved in a hashed format to protect user credentials and maintain security. Sessions are managed efficiently to keep users logged in across different pages, and access to certain routes is restricted unless the user is authenticated. This ensures that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations such as modifying listings or changing profile information.

The application’s layout and presentation use basic **HTML** and custom **CSS**. I did not use any external frontend framework like Bootstrap, as I styled it manually through a stylesheet named `style.css` in the `static/css/` folder. **JavaScript** usage in the project is minimal. The `script.js` file in `static/js/` simply logs the message `"Grabbit loaded"` to confirm that scripts are functioning properly.

User-uploaded product images are stored in the `uploads/` folder. These images link to individual listings and display on their detail pages. Making the image display responsive across various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, was a small challenge. I addressed it using custom **CSS media queries** that adjust the layout and image dimensions for a better user experience on all devices.

The project’s HTML templates are in the `templates/` folder and follow Flask's **Jinja2** templating system. The `base.html` file serves as a foundation for other templates, helping to reuse common components like the navigation bar and footer. The `index.html`, `login.html`, and `register.html` pages cover the core user flow. The templates `create_listing.html`, `edit_listing.html`, and `listing_detail.html` manage the product listing operations. For profile management, users can view and edit their account information through profile.html and edit_profile.html. These templates dynamically render content based on the user’s session and database entries, allowing for a personalized and interactive experience across the application.

**Grabbit** includes search and filter features so users can quickly find listings that match their interests. Each listing has detailed information like the title, description, price, category, location, and an image, forming a complete product display. The main logic and routes of the application are handled in `app.py`. The `models.py` file defines the data models using **SQLAlchemy ORM**, while `config.py` contains configuration settings such as upload paths and secret keys. This keeps the code modular, secure, and easy to maintain. The requirements.txt file lists all the Python packages required to run the project, enabling others to quickly set up the development environment using tools like pip. Together, these files form the backbone of the application, ensuring clear separation of concerns and smooth functionality across different parts of the project.

Creating this project helped me understand the real-world process of web development. I learned about database design, user authentication, layout structuring, and image handling. It gave me hands-on experience with both backend and frontend development. Even though it’s a basic application, I learned how full-stack systems work and how different technologies come together to form a functioning product.

In the future, I would like to add more features to **Grabbit**, such as messaging between buyers and sellers, notifications, listing categories, and even payment integration. For now, I am proud of what I’ve accomplished and excited to keep improving it as I gain more knowledge in web technologies and computer science overall.
